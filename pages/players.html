                            It's OK to get Rib-grease on your face, because you're allowing people to see that you're proud of these ribs. Go with the feeling of the nature. Take it easy. Know why you’re here. And remember to balance your internal energy with the environment.Did you feel that? Look at me – I’m not out of breath anymore!
